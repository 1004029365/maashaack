~~eden AS3 has been injected into the maashaack framework~~,
and now you can find the most recent version in the *system.serializers.eden* package.

eden AS3 will return in its own repository
 * with the new organization you will find it in `/libraries/eden`
 * the class path will be `libraries.eden.*`
 * and then `system.serializers.eden` would be like an addon to integrate the library with the framework
