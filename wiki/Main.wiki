welcome to maashaack.

[http://code.google.com/p/maashaack/w/list list all the wiki pages]

We need to put some efforts to update the documentation,
some parts need to be rewritten.

So for now don't trust all our docs ;).

We've been pretty busy with job stuff, hence why the projects have not been updated that much the last 6 months or so.

So the actual battle plan is the following:
 * restructure all the documentation
 * clean what have to be cleaned, wether it's the doc or code or build etc.
 * make maashaack our different projects HQ and document that
 something we call our code galaxy
 * talk more about code
 * write more code

and try to seriously kick some butts (and ours first).

=== what's coming next ===

  * smaller releases, instead of v0.1 then 0.2 which last about 6 months, expect 0.2.1, 0.2.2, etc. which we gonan try to fit in 1 month or less
  * avoid to depend on svn::external on the trunk, basically only us the commiters need that as we jungle with different projets at the same time, so each build (like 0.2.1) will have SWC and ABC frozen
  * upgrade from Flex SDK 3.x to Flex SDK 4.x, different reasons for that but mainly the improved command-line tools like mxmlc, asdoc, etc.
  * ditch Flash Player 9 for Flash Player 10 only, FP10 is at more than 80% spread and we want the most optimized code possible and only FP10 can use the `Vector` class
  * *maybe* conditional compilation in some part of the code instead of namespaces
