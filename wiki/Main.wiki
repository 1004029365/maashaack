welcome to maashaack.

[http://code.google.com/p/maashaack/w/list list all the wiki pages]

We need to put some efforts to update the documentation,
some parts need to be rewritten.

So for now don't trust all our docs ;).

We've been pretty busy with job stuff, hence why the projects have not been updated that much the last 6 months or so.

So the actual battle plan is the following:
 * restructure all the documentation
 * clean what have to be cleaned, wether it's the doc or code or build etc.
 * make maashaack our different projects HQ and document that
 something we call our code galaxy
 * talk more about code
 * write more code

and try to seriously kick some butts (and ours first).

=== what's happening now ===

  * we're using [http://code.google.com/p/gclient/ gclient]
    * goal: remove svn::external and replace with gclient DEPS to organize multi-projects into one
    * goal: remove svn::external and replace with SWC for library dependencies
    * goal: be able to have different solutions reusing the same different projects (ex: maashaack vs maashaackSA)
    * goal: be able to sync with different SCM (svn and git)
  * we're splitin' a big framework into independent projects
    * goal: every project have its own branches/tags/trunk
    * goal: projects can be local to the maashaack repo or external (any other svn or git repo)
    * goal: every project can build independently (ant, mxmlc, asdoc, etc.)
    * goal: every project produce an independent SWC and/or SWF and/or ABC
  * refactor of important libraries to remove/reorganize dependencies

=== what's coming next ===

  * smaller releases, instead of v0.1 then 0.2 which last about 6 months, expect 0.2.1, 0.2.2, etc. which we gonan try to fit in 1 month or less
  * avoid to depend on svn::external on the trunk, basically only us the commiters need that as we jungle with different projets at the same time, so each build (like 0.2.1) will have SWC and ABC frozen
  * ~~maybe~~ use [http://code.google.com/p/gclient/ gclient] to organize the different projects from the SVN
  * upgrade from Flex SDK 3.x to Flex SDK 4.x, different reasons for that but mainly the improved command-line tools like mxmlc, asdoc, etc.
  * ~~ditch Flash Player 9 for Flash Player 10 only, FP10 is at more than 80% spread and we want the most optimized code possible and only FP10 can use the `Vector` class~~
  * we will support both Flash Player 9 and Flash Player 10 via conditional compilation and generating 2 different SWC, but now we will not support anymore compiling from Flash CS3 (as this IDE does not support CC)
  * ~~maybe~~ conditional compilation in some part of the code instead of namespaces (see ConditionalCompilation)
