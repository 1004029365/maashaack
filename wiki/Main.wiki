welcome to maashaack.

[http://code.google.com/p/maashaack/w/list list all the wiki pages]

We need to put some efforts to update the documentation,
some parts need to be rewritten.

So for now don't trust all our docs ;).

We've been pretty busy with job stuff, hence why the projects have not been updated that much the last 6 months or so.

So the actual battle plan is the following:
 * restructure all the documentation
 * clean what have to be cleaned, wether it's the doc or code or build etc.
 * make maashaack our different projects HQ and document that
 something we call our code galaxy
 * talk more about code
 * write more code

and try to seriously kick some butts (and ours first).
