#summary Everything about the local build.

== Introduction ==

A local build is really a very basic and simple Ant build.

There are 3 files in total
  * the *build.xml* in the project
  * the *build.properties* that configure the project
  * the *meta.xml* that actually do the build

All those files are organised based on the project structure.
