#summary Conditional compilation options explained.

== Introduction ==

Even if we try to make our AS3 code as portable as possible
we have to deal with different little nuggets

 * diff of Flash Player API (FP9 vs FP10 etc.)
 * diff between Flash Player API and AIR API
 * diff between Flash Player API and Tamarin/redtamarin


== Options ==

=== TAMARIN::exclude ===

Excludes block of code when compiling for Tamarin/redtamarin

some examples:

{{{
TAMARIN::exclude
{
    suite.addTestSuite( TextFieldTargetTest );
}
}}}



=== TAMARIN::alternate ===

Allows to provide an alternative for Tamarin/redtamarin only
