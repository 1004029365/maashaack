#summary interfaces in AS3.

== Introduction ==

{{{
Interfaces provide a way for programs to express contracts between the producers and consumers of objects.
These contracts are type safe, easy to understand, and efficient to implement.
Programs should not have to pay a significant performance penalty for using interfaces.

An interface is a type whose methods must be defined by every class that claims to implement it.
Multiple interfaces can be inherited by another interface through the extends clause or by a class through the implements clause.
Instances of a class that implements an interface belong to the type represented by the interface.
Interface definitions must only contain function definitions, which may include get and set methods.

Interface methods are not public by default, but are added to the public namespace
by the implementing method definition.
