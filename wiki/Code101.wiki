#summary get the code.

== Introduction ==

We work on *maashaack* for many years, and now we come to a point<br>
where we had to reorganize the code to allow the project to evolve.

If at the beginning we were planing just an application framework,<br>
now we are dealing with the organisation of an application framework<br>
but also the organisation of libraries, tools and platform libraries.

That means only using Subversion and only using one repository is not enough, we need more.

After different personal experiences (at work and with big commercial projects),<br>
a lot of discussions about code dependencies, organisations, builds, etc.<br>
and about one full year of numerous tests and experiments<br>
we think we came up with a "system" that works.

In summary, we copied (more or less) what Google did with Chrome (and Chromium)<br>
and now we have *solutions* of code that you can check out with *gclient*.

Those solutions are much more simple that what Google Chrome does,<br>
we have only one *DEPS* file at the root of a *config* which is used to create a solution.

By default we have two main solutions:
  * maashaack<br>the fusion of all the sources in one single project
  * maashaackSA<br>each project considered as standalone module<br>and organised in numerous projects


== New ==

You will need the [gclient] tool.

If you want to work with all the projects fused in a *src* folder
{{{
$gclient config https://maashaack.googlecode.com/svn/configs/maashaack
$gclient update
}}}

If you want to work on each projects independently (SA: Stand Alone)
{{{
$gclient config https://maashaack.googlecode.com/svn/configs/maashaackSA
$gclient update
}}}


If you need to work on boths (developers/commiters)<br>
copy `https://maashaack.googlecode.com/svn/configs/solutions.txt`
{{{
$mv solutions.txt .gclient
$gclient update
}}}

<br>
<br>

== Old ==

{{{
$svn checkout http://maashaack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/AS3 maashaack
}}}
