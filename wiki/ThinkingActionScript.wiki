== We are Hybrid ==

AS3 is not Java nor C#, sure we can borrow principle and recipes from other languages but we have to keep thinking with the great features found in our language.

You see often the opposition of class-based programming vs prototype-based programming,
but with AS3 you can do both, you can do what I call *Hybrid programming* and this is very powerfull.

This page will list some point of view, approach, etc. on common code organization, code design, etc.
