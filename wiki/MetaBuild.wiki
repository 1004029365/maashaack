#summary How to use the MetaBuild.

== Introduction ==

What we call a *MetaBuild* is simply an Ant build that drives other ant builds.

Because we deal with a lot of packages, libraries, tools and platform libraries<br>
we defined a way to build them all in sequence
  * to be able to order them (eg. build *A* before *B*)
  * to be able to sync' them (eg. copy *A* into *B* libs)
  * to be able to distribute them (eg. copy *A* binaries in dist folder or into a zip file)
  * to be able to tag them (eg. build *A*, *B*, *C* and tag them "beta 1")
