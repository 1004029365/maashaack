== Introduction ==

This is the application framework for !ActionScript 3<br>
which have the only purpose to provide portable<br>
cross-platform and standard packages.

The *maashaack application framework*<br>
(codename *x4a* eg. "anything for !ActionScript")<br>
is a set of different modular projects assembled together<br>
to produce a coherent set of AS3 classes, packages and libraries<br>
which represent our ideal of "programming in the large".

Don't get confused by the word "framework", <br>
we don't impose any architecture, abstract design,<br>
default behaviour or force you to use subclassing<br>
here you can read "application framework" as<br>
"the minimal set of libraries to write an application".

== Portability ==

main targets
 * Flash Player 10.3
 * AIR 2.7
 * [http://code.google.com/p/redtamarin/ redtamarin] 0.3.2

not supported but possible to backport
 * Flash Player 9
 * Flash Player 10
 * Flash Player 10.1
 * Flash Player 10.2
 * AIR 1.0
 * AIR 1.5
 * AIR 2.0
 * AIR 2.5

 * redtamarin 0.2.5

== Details ==

Inspired by such projects as Mono, Python, Ruby, etc.
the goal here is to provide a set of libraries that
are made right from the start portable in the AS3 world.

The focus is on the AS3 language, APIs available for
the Flash Player, AIR, redtamarin or any other AS3 host.
