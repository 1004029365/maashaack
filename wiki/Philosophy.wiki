#the dirty secrets behind writing portable ES4 code.

= Introduction =

Considering that [http://www.ecmascript.org/ ECMAScript 4 specification] is not final
the simple answer would be "you can't", but being the impatient kind I say "f*ck it".

Right now we have a good subset of ES4 impersonated as ActionScript 3 (AS3),
the good folks at Adobe are actively participating in ECMA TG1 and seems to have
the will to not add incompatible features.

Let's target AS3 code, and then refactor later, at least it would be a good
use of that good yer old svn, but let's do it with a grain of brain.

= Details =

let's establish some rules, you would not think we gonna code all that in the wild
not thinking about forward compatiblity do you ?

 * rule #1
 embrace ECMAScript, you're not coding Java or .NET here, so as a first rule
 never ever fall in the trap of thinking AS3 is ever related to those other guys.
