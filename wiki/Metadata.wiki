#metadata tags in AS3 and Flex.

= Introduction =

from the Flex documentation
 Metadata statements are associated with a class declaration, an individual data field,
 or a method. They are bound to the next line in the file. When you define a component
 property or method, add the metadata tag on the line before the property
 or method declaration.
