The collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, allowing them to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. It reduces programming effort while increasing performance.

The *system.data collection* framework is loosely inspired on the [http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/collections/ JAVA Collections Framework] and the [http://commons.apache.org/collections/ Jakarta Collections Framework].

This framework is inspired on interfaces to defines the different types of collections :
 * Map
 * Bag
 * Collections
 * Iterator
 * Set
 * Queue & Stack
