#summary we need bigger tools.

= Set up your development environment =

All our projects are dependant on certain languages, tools, compilers, interpreters, etc.

Here we describe how you need to set up your environment to be able to work on those different projects (and by work I mean: editing, patching, compiling, etc.), this is if you are a developer, if you are a end-user you don't need to do all that and you should find pre-compiled libraries and tools in the [http://code.google.com/p/maashaack/downloads/list download] section.

== default tools ==

we expect you to have on your system
 * svn
 * python
 * java


== extra tools ==

 * [http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi Apache Ant 1.7.1]
 * [gclient gclient 0.3.4]


== Command-line shell ==

We build everything on the command-line

if you are on Windows
 * [http://www.cygwin.com/ cygwin]
 * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/ console] (optional)

for OS X and Linux, the default terminals are all that you need
