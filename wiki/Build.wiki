#summary How to build the projects from source.

== Introduction ==

Before you build you need a fair good understanding of the [ProjectStructure projects structure].

All our builds use Ant.

We have different types of build
  * local build, from within the project
  * [MetaBuild], a build driving other builds

== Building a single project ==

Select the category (either `packages`, `libraries`, `tools` or `platform`)<br>
and select a project name.

Go into the root folder of this project<br>
for ex: `../packages/core`

Run the local build<br>
{{{
$ ant
}}}
or
{{{
$ ant -f build.xml
}}}

You will get the result of the build in the `bin-release` folder.

*build defaults*

A local build will expect a path for a Flex SDK<br>
our default build.xml use
{{{
<property name="FLEX_HOME_MAC" value="/OpenSource/Flex/sdks/4.5.0" />
<property name="FLEX_HOME_WIN" value="c:/OpenSource/Flex/sdks/4.5.0" />
}}}

*build options*

By default, with a local build we always build the documentation (with ASDoc)<br>
but you can desactivate it like that
{{{
ant -Dbuild.nodocumentation=true
}}}

*custom local build*

If you're not happy with some defaults or you have special needs<br>
just copy *build.xml* to say *build-custom.xml*<br>
and edit accordingly

for ex:
{{{
<property name="FLEX_HOME_MAC" value="/dev_stuff/Adobe/Flex_sdks_4.5.0" />
}}}
