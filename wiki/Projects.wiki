The *maashaack application framework*<br>
is a set of different modular projects assembled together<br>
to produce a coherent set of AS3 classes, packages and libraries<br>
which represent our ideal of "programming in the large".

[Framework Maashaack Application Framework]

<br><br>

The *maashaack projects*<br>
are independent modules which focus on one particular set of problem,<br>
they fit the need of "programming in the small".

One of the goal is to write first applications and then reinject the general code into an organized structure.

It could become part of the packages, libraries, platform libraries or tools, see the [OverView documentation overview].

Off course if you feel you're into that [Philosophy], you're welcome to participate
with your own project, see [Organization#Add_your_Project_to_maashaack add your Project to maashaack].
