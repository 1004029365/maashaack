#summary framework overview.

== Introduction ==

The maashaack project provide different stuff.

The *maashaack application framework*<br>
is a set of different modular projects assembled together<br>
to produce a coherent set of AS3 classes, packages and libraries<br>
which represent our ideal of "programming in the large".

The *maashaack projects*<br>
are independent modules which focus on one particular set of problem,<br>
they fit the need of "programming in the small".

The *maashaack tools*<br>
are executable tools in relation with the AS3 language and/or the Flash Platform<br>
their goal is to cover small area not covered by much bigger tools (like the Flex SDK).

The *maashaack documentation*<br>
focus mainly on the use of the different frameworks, classes, libraries, etc.<br>
but also try to assemble the best ressources related to AS3 and Flash development in general.

== Packages ==

We do not believe the classic `com/org/net + company name + product name`<br>
apply to a general framework naming system.

=== core ===

The core package is specialized in function utilities that are highly reusable without creating any dependencies.
