#summary the avmglue platform library.
#labels Introduction

== Introduction ==

avmglue is an open source implementation of the following runtimes API:
 * Flash Player 9
 * Flash Player 10
 * Flash Player 10.1
 * AIR 1.0
 * AIR 1.5
 * AIR 2.0

We will refer to it as the Flash Platform API , shortened to *FPAPI*.

Based on publicly accessible documentation:
[http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/beta/reference/actionscript/3/package-summary.html BETA ActionScript 3.0 Reference for the Adobe Flash Platform]<br>
[http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/ ActionScript 3.0 Reference for the Adobe Flash Platform]<br>
[http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AS3LCR/Flash_10.0/ Flash CS4 Professional ActionScript 3.0 Language Reference]<br>
etc.

The goal is to implement in AS3 and/or native C/C++ the FPAPI in order to generate `*.abc` files compatible with [http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/ Tamarin].

This platform library is used by [http://code.google.com/p/redtamarin/ redtamarin].

== Details ==

You have a great program in AS3 working with Flash Player or AIR
but you want to reuse it or part of the source code in a command line tool

something like
{{{
package
{
    import flash.display.Sprite;

    public class Main extends Sprite
    {
        //...
    }
}
}}}

will simply not work in the context of Tamarin because there is no `Sprite` class definition.

<br><br>

You need to mock FPAPI classes for particular tests and/or unit tests,
the problem is that those classes are only available trough `playerglobal.swc`, `airglobal.swc`, etc.
and in fact are embedded directly in the runtime executable, you can not change them.

By using *avmglue* and Tamarin, you can change those classes,<br>
for ex: you can force the locale to be `FR_fr` on a `US_gb` system<br>
or you can emulate the domain `www.domain.com` on your localhost<br>
etc.
