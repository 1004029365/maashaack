#summary the gclient tool.

== Introduction ==

gclient (or google client) is a set of wrapper scripts for checking out and updating source code from multiple SCM repository locations.

The project started here [http://code.google.com/p/gclient/ http://code.google.com/p/gclient/]<br>
but is now integrated in the Chromium [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools depot_tools].

On the [http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools/gclient depot_tools/gclient] page you can find more informations.

{{{
    gclient was originally developed for internal use by the Google Chrome team,
    to coordinate pieces of code from different SCM repositories during the development process.
    The sources are included inside depot_tools.

== informations ==

We use *gclient* on top of *svn* for all of our projects.

See [Organization#if_you_are_a_Committer] for the greedy details.

In short, we replace all the `svn:externals` by `DEPS` file and use gclient to sync and update, for the commits we simply navigate into each project directory and do a `svn commit` there.

*Why are we doing that ?*<br>
It is easier for us to maintain different small projects that get assembled in a big directory structure than to maintain a huge monolithic project.

*What are the advantages of `DEPS` files ?*<br>
 * It is really like a `svn:externals` but with the difference that it is a file instead of a svn property, so for us it is clearer to see the mapping of directories in those `DEPS` files.
 * it allow us from the same sources to assemble different structure of projects, see [http://code.google.com/p/maashaack/source/browse/#svn/configs/maashaack maashaack] and [http://code.google.com/p/maashaack/source/browse/#svn/configs/maashaackSA maashaackSA].
 * it allows to have a prent/child relationship between projects.
