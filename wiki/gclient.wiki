#summary the gclient tool.

== Introduction ==

gclient (or google client) is a set of wrapper scripts for checking out and updating source code from multiple SCM repository locations.

The project started here [http://code.google.com/p/gclient/ http://code.google.com/p/gclient/]<br>
but is now integrated in the Chromium [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools depot_tools].

On the [http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools/gclient depot_tools/gclient] page you can find more informations.

{{{
    gclient was originally developed for internal use by the Google Chrome team,
    to coordinate pieces of code from different SCM repositories during the development process.
    The sources are included inside depot_tools.
