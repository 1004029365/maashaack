#summary how to organize the structure of a project.

== Introduction ==

Here are the basic rules to organize a project  directories, build, different setups, etc.

The goal is to have the same structure for each projects to automate builds globally.

== Directories =

{{{
$ROOT = one of the roots (packages,libraries,tools,platform,etc.)
$NAME = the project name

$ROOT
  |_ $NAME
    |_ branches
    |_ tags
    |_ trunk
}}}

{{{
...
 |_ trunk
        |_ bin                 -> files generated by the build
        |_ bin-debug   -> files from your manual/local build
        |_ build             -> configuration and libraries of the automated build
        |_ docs              -> general documentation files
        |     |_ $NAME   -> HTML documentation generated by asdoc
        |     |_ ...            -> other files (image, UML, etc. )
        |     
        |_ examples      -> examples files (*.fla, *.as, *.mxml, etc.)
        |_ gfx                 -> all binary resource files
        |     |_ fla           -> *.fla
        |     |_ img         -> *.png, *.gif, *.jpg

        |_ lib                 -> source code libraries (*.as)
        |_ lib-swc        -> compiled libraries (*.swc)
        |_ src                -> the source code of the current project NAME
        |_ templates    -> templates base files to be used by the build
