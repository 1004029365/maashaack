#summary the asdoc tool.

== Introduction ==

All maashaack projects are documented with asdoc from the Flex 4 SDK.

We debated a lot on wether using [http://www.naturaldocs.org/ NaturalDocs] because of the wiki-style comments
or asdoc, but because asdoc reuse the same workflow of the mxmlc and compc compilers we decided to stay with
the Flex SDK toolchain.

But asdoc is far from perfect and it can be a `b*tch` to configure it to output exactly what you want,
so we took an hybrid approach.

Basically, all main code documentation is in asdoc comments, but extended documentation is linked here on the wiki.

In short, if we have to write more than few lines of documentation, we use a `@see` tag in asdoc and point a wiki page.
